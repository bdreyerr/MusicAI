# What are we building

- We are buidling a Digital Audio Workstation, where we can manipulate audio files and create music
- This program will be very similar to Ableton Live and Logic Pro
- There is a timeline where audio and midi tracks can be added and manipulated to build a song or other audio creation

# How should we build this project

- We are using SwiftUI and AppKit to build the front end UI / UX for this project
- The backend and audio processing system will be built with Swift and utilize apple's AVFoundation and Core Audio libraries.

# Testing Changes

- Please never try to 'run' the project yourself in agent mode. This project is built with xcode and cannot be built from the command line.
- The user will always have to build and run the program manually, please just ask the user to test the changes manually and report back.
